# Superstore-Data-Analysis-End-to-End-AWS-Data-Engineering-Project-for-Beginners

We created IM am user and a S3 bucket where we will put the orders data of a super store. We put the data and saw how we can analyze that incremental data so that we put the data in S3 where we had created bucket folders.
Then we used AWS glue to run the crawler and created the data catalog. We did data analysis on AWS Athena and saw how we can analyze that S3 data we can run queries SQL queries in AWS Athena. At the end we created some charts using Amazon Quicksight.
Amazon Quicksight ( just like Tableau, Power BI) is a AWS product where we can create the visualization. We automated everything and saw how we can do it in AWS.
